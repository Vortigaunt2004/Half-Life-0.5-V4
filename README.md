# Half-Life-0.5-V4
Download or paste this code into a text editor that uses python and run :)
This is a Python code that simulates a simple game where the player encounters enemies and fights against them.
The Player class represents the player, with attributes for health, armor, and ammo, and methods for attacking and defending. The attack method reduces the ammo count by 1 and returns a random damage value between 10 and 20. The defend method calculates the damage received by subtracting the enemy's damage from the player's armor. If the armor is greater than or equal to the damage, it reduces the armor count, and if not, it reduces the health count by the difference between the damage and armor. The is_alive method returns a boolean indicating whether the player's health is greater than 0.
The game has a list of enemies, each represented as a dictionary with a name, health, and damage value. The random_encounter function randomly selects an enemy from the list and prints a message about the encounter.
The game loop starts by creating a Player instance with health=100, armor=50, and ammo=30. It then enters an infinite loop where it repeatedly selects an enemy using random_encounter, and enters a battle loop where the player and the enemy take turns attacking and defending until one of them is defeated. The player can choose to attack or defend on their turn. If the player wins, they receive a random amount of ammo and health as loot.
The code could be improved by adding more variety to the enemy encounters, adding more actions for the player to choose from, and implementing a game over condition.
